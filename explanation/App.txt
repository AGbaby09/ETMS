The App component doesn't directly handle visual rendering, but it does define the structure of the application's layout.
It likely renders a main content area represented by the <main> element with a class of App scrollable.
The appearance of the application would depend on the components rendered within each route defined by React Router.
Components such as ToggleLogin, Login, SignUp, and LoggedIn would likely contain forms, login/signup interfaces, and user dashboard elements.
If openRide is true, the AccRide component would be rendered, which could represent a section or modal related to accessing a ride or similar feature but what it mainly does it show a modal to book
