Appearance:

The appearance is defined by the JSX returned by the component.
It consists of a section with the id Dashboard, likely representing the main content area of the dashboard page.
The section contains two main sections: count and graph.
The count section displays the total number of employees, drivers, vehicles, and a doughnut chart representing these totals.
The graph section displays a bar chart representing different statistics related to rides, such as seats, boarded passengers, and times of ride.
