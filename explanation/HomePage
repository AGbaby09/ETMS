The ToggleLogin component

Manages user role selection for logging in.
Uses React Router's useNavigate hook to handle navigation to different routes.
Utilizes React hooks such as useState and useContext for managing state and accessing context variables.
Animates the appearance of the component by adding a CSS class after a delay of 2000 milliseconds.

The appearance is defined by the JSX returned by the component.
It consists of a section with the id ToggleLogin, containing two main sections: homeTitle and toggleOptions.
The homeTitle section likely represents the header or title of the page, displaying the application name, description, and an image of a bus.
The toggleOptions section contains buttons for selecting different user roles for login (e.g., admin, employee).

Overall, the ToggleLogin component provides a visually appealing and user-friendly interface for selecting a user role and navigating to the appropriate login page within the application.
