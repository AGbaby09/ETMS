This is a React component named NavBar, which appears to represent a navigation sidebar for the logged-in interface of the application. Here's a breakdown of what it does and how it might look:

Manages user authentication by accessing the auth context from AuthContext.
Utilizes React Router's useNavigate hook to handle navigation within the application.
Provides a logout function that clears the user's authentication token from local storage, resets the authentication context, and navigates the user back to the login page.
Renders navigation links based on the user's role. Certain links are conditional based on the user's role, showing different options for different roles.

The appearance is defined by the JSX returned by the component.
It consists of a <nav> element with the id SideBar, representing the sidebar navigation menu.
Inside the navigation menu, it displays the user's avatar, email, and role.
It includes a list of navigation links represented as buttons, each with an icon and text.

Overall, the NavBar component provides a functional and visually appealing navigation menu for users accessing the logged-in interface of the application. It dynamically adjusts the available options based on the user's role, enhancing usability and security.
