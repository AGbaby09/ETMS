React is html, css, and js combined. So you can argue that for easy development, react was found suitable because you are able to build components

Project Codes are in the src forlder in the Project folder

It starts with App.jsx




Using React can be somewhat similar to using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but there are important differences and additional features to consider. Here's how they compare:

HTML:

In HTML, you define the structure of your web page using elements like <div>, <p>, <h1>, etc.
HTML provides the skeleton of your webpage, organizing content into sections and defining the layout.
In React, you still define the structure of your UI, but you do it using JSX (a syntax extension for JavaScript), which looks similar to HTML. However, JSX allows you to embed JavaScript expressions within your markup, making it more dynamic and powerful.
CSS:

In CSS, you style your HTML elements by targeting them with selectors and applying styles like colors, fonts, margins, and padding.
CSS provides the visual presentation and layout of your webpage.
In React, you still use CSS for styling, but you can also use inline styles or CSS-in-JS libraries to style your components. React allows you to encapsulate styles within components, making it easier to manage styles for individual parts of your application.
JavaScript:

In plain JavaScript, you add interactivity to your webpage, manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model), handle events, fetch data, etc.
JavaScript adds behavior to your webpage, making it dynamic and responsive.
In React, JavaScript is used extensively to define the logic and behavior of your components. You write JavaScript code to define component state, handle user interactions, fetch data from APIs, and perform other tasks. React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the actual DOM, which can result in better performance compared to directly manipulating the DOM in traditional JavaScript applications.
Differences:

React introduces the concept of components, which are reusable, self-contained units of UI. Components allow you to break your UI into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to build and maintain complex applications.
React provides a unidirectional data flow, meaning data flows from parent components to child components through props, and child components can notify parent components of changes using callbacks.
React encourages a declarative programming style, where you describe what you want your UI to look like based on the current state, rather than imperatively manipulating the DOM to achieve a desired outcome.
In summary, while React shares some similarities with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it introduces new concepts and patterns that make it well-suited for building modern, interactive web applications.
