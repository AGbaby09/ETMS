This is a React component named Employees, which appears to represent a page for managing employee information and registration. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and appearance:

Functionality:

Manages user authentication by accessing the auth context from AuthContext.
Utilizes React Router's useNavigate hook to handle navigation within the application.
Fetches the list of employees from the server upon component mount using the useEffect hook and Axios.
Provides a form for registering new employees with fields for fullname, email, number, branch, area, and photo.
Displays the list of employees in a table format with columns for fullname, email, number, branch, area, shift, and status.
Appearance:

The appearance is defined by the JSX returned by the component.
It consists of a section with the id Employees, likely representing the main content area of the employees page.
Inside this section, there are two main divisions: one for the employee registration form (FillForm) and another for displaying all employees.
The registration form includes input fields for employee details and a preview section for the employee photo.
The section for displaying all employees includes a table with rows and columns to represent employee information.
Styling:

The appearance is further influenced by CSS styles defined in the accompanying Employees.css and FillForm.css files, which are imported at the top of the component file.
The CSS likely defines styles for layout, positioning, typography, colors, and other visual aspects of the page.

Overall, the Employees component provides functionality for managing employee data, including both registration of new employees and display of existing ones. It ensures that only authenticated users can access the page and fetches employee data from the server to populate the list.
