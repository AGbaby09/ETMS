Manages user authentication by sending a POST request to a specified endpoint (/api/v1/{role}/login) with the user's email and password.
Uses Axios for making HTTP requests.
Utilizes React hooks such as useState, useContext, and useEffect for managing state and side effects.
Redirects the user to the /loggedIn route if they are already authenticated (i.e., if auth.token exists).
Displays an error message if authentication fails.
Provides an option to toggle password visibility.
Handles form submission and loading state while waiting for the server response.

The appearance is defined by the JSX returned by the component.
It consists of a <section> element with the id form, which likely encapsulates the entire login form.
The form includes input fields for email and password, along with a button for submitting the form.
There's a link/button for forgotten passwords and another button for signing up.
Additionally, there's an animated loading icon displayed while waiting for the server response.

Overall, the Login component provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their credentials, handles authentication requests, and provides feedback to the user based on the server response.
